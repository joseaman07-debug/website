# Editorial Personal Website

This repository contains a clean, editorial-style personal website built with
semantic HTML and a single CSS stylesheet. The layout uses neutral tones,
minimal typography, and a structured homepage to highlight selected work,
writing, and contact information.

## Structure

- `index.html` — homepage layout with hero, work, writing, and contact sections.
- `styles.css` — neutral color palette and editorial typography styling.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site. If you are using a local
development server, serve the repository root so the stylesheet loads
correctly.
